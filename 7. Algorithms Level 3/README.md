# Algorithms Level 3 Course

    This course has 50 problems and 2 projects ;)

#   The problems are the following :
    [X] Problem 1 : Write A Program to fill 3x3 matrix with random numbers and print it
    [X] Problem 2 : Write A Program to fill 3x3 matrix with random numbers and print it then print each row sum
    [X] Problem 3 : Write A Program to fill 3x3 matrix with random numbers and print it then print each row sum but each rom sum is inside an array
    [X] Problem 4 : Write A Program to fill 3x3 matrix with random numbers and print it then print each col sum
    [X] Problem 5 : Write A Program to fill 3x3 matrix with random numbers and print it then print each col sum but each col sum is inside an array
    [X] Problem 6 : Write A Program to fill 3x3 matrix with ordered numbers then print it
    [X] Problem 7 : Write A Program to fill 3x3 matrix with ordered numbers then print it and make another 2d vector to fill it in transposed format
    [X] Problem 8 : Write A Program to fill 2 (3x3 matrix) with ordered numbers then print it and make another 2d vector to multiply first 2d vector by the second 2d vector
    [X] Problem 9 : Write A Program to fill 1 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to print specific row and column
    [X] Problem 10 : Write A Program to fill 1 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to print the sum of the matrix elements
    [X] Problem 11 : Write A Program to fill 2 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to print if the sum of both matrixs are equal or not
    [X] Problem 12 : Write A Program to fill 2 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to print if both matrixs are typical or not
    [X] Problem 13 : Write A Program to fill 2 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to check if the matrix is identity matrix or not then print the result
    [X] Problem 14 : Write A Program to fill 2 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to check if the matrix is scalar matrix or not then print the result
    [X] Problem 15 : Write A Program to fill 2 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to check how many times does the number found
    [X] Problem 16 : Write A Program to fill 2 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to check if the matrix is sparce matrix or not then print the result

## *i will add the remaining problems soon inshallah :)*
