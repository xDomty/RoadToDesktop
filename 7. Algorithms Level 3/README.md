# Algorithms Level 3 Course

    This course has 50 problems and 2 projects ;)

#   The problems are the following :
    [X] Problem 01 : Write A Program to fill 3x3 matrix with random numbers and print it
    [X] Problem 02 : Write A Program to fill 3x3 matrix with random numbers and print it then print each row sum
    [X] Problem 03 : Write A Program to fill 3x3 matrix with random numbers and print it then print each row sum but each rom sum is inside an array
    [X] Problem 04 : Write A Program to fill 3x3 matrix with random numbers and print it then print each col sum
    [X] Problem 05 : Write A Program to fill 3x3 matrix with random numbers and print it then print each col sum but each col sum is inside an array
    [X] Problem 06 : Write A Program to fill 3x3 matrix with ordered numbers then print it
    [X] Problem 07 : Write A Program to fill 3x3 matrix with ordered numbers then print it and make another 2d vector to fill it in transposed format
    [X] Problem 08 : Write A Program to fill 2 (3x3 matrix) with ordered numbers then print it and make another 2d vector to multiply first 2d vector by the second 2d vector
    [X] Problem 09 : Write A Program to fill 1 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to print specific row and column
    [X] Problem 10 : Write A Program to fill 1 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to print the sum of the matrix elements
    [X] Problem 11 : Write A Program to fill 2 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to print if the sum of both matrixs are equal or not
    [X] Problem 12 : Write A Program to fill 2 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to print if both matrixs are typical or not
    [X] Problem 13 : Write A Program to fill 2 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to check if the matrix is identity matrix or not then print the result
    [X] Problem 14 : Write A Program to fill 2 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to check if the matrix is scalar matrix or not then print the result
    [X] Problem 15 : Write A Program to fill 2 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to check how many times does the number found
    [X] Problem 16 : Write A Program to fill 2 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to check if the matrix is sparce matrix or not then print the result
    [X] Problem 17 : Write A Program to fill 2 (3x3 matrix) and make a function to check if the number you entered is found in matrix or not
    [X] Problem 18 : check the intersected numbers
    [X] Problem 19 : check the max and the min of the matrix
    [X] Problem 20 : check if the matrix is a palindrome or not
    [X] Problem 21 : print a Fibonacci series using for loops
    [X] Problem 22 : print a Fibonacci series using recursion
    [X] Problem 23 : print the first letter of each word
    [X] Problem 24 : enter a text and capitalize the first letter of each word then print the text
    [X] Problem 25 : enter a text and make the first letter of each word lowercase then print the text
    [X] Problem 26 : enter a text then convert it all to uppercase and lowercase
    [X] Problem 27 : enter a char then convert it to upper is it is lower and vice versa
    [X] Problem 28 : invert string case
    [X] Problem 29 : upper lower length count
	[X] Problem 30 : read string and chracter then count the character in the string
    [X] Problem 31 : read string and chracter then count the character in the string and count the char upper and lower together
## *i will add the remaining problems soon inshallah :)*
